# HuggingFace Community Event Project

Back in November 2021, I attended the HuggingFace community event. Part of the event involved creating a HuggingFace space, so I create [a space for extending MIDI data](https://huggingface.co/spaces/psistolar/pop-music-transformer). 

The timeline for the event was pretty short (having to do some Thanksgiving travel cut into it), but the end product still felt like a success. I did not come up with anything fancy on the NLP side: I used the [musicautobot repo] and exlanations therein, fine-tuned the model, and set it up to work with spaces. The use of the model and fine-tuning was pretty straightforward due to the great documentation from MusicAutobot and HuggingFace, so my light contribution was setting up the Gradio space to accept MIDI data, extend it, and return both the extended MIDI as well as an audio recording.

The core idea from MusicAutobot is to convert MIDI to text by creating tokens for notes as well as special separator tokens, and then fine-tune Transformer-XL on this data. The special separator was a neat idea, because this allowed the model to more easily learn chord "phrases". Rather than worry about converting a chord to a special object, the model trains on the idea of grouping note "words", which simplifies the process and creates musical results.
